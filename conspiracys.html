                <h3>Free will is a myth. Religion is a joke. Wake up, we're all pawns controlled by something greater. Memes, the DNA of the soul. They shape our will. They are the culture, they are everything we pass on. Expose someone to the truth long enough, they will learn to see it. They become a carrier. Envy, greed, despair... All memes. All passed along.</h3>

                <h3>Unlike everyone else walking around unaware of the truth, we know. RGU is just a coverup by the government to hide their secret Multiversal Drill. That's right, beneath RGU is a drill that is digging into the Multiverse itself. Have you ever seen someone strange walking about campus? The men disguised as students disapearing underneath the building and returning hours later? The clones from other dimensions wandering around? Stop living in ignorance and open your eyes!</h3>

                <h3>You might have thought that the Multiversal Drill mentioned reviously was being run by the Scottish government, but you're wrong! It's always been the Iluminati, controlling from the shadows and slowly converting more and more to their ranks, making those who disagree with them disapear, scattered across the multiverse...</h3>

                <h3> Have you or a loved one heard strange noises coming from downstream? Perhaps odd sights in the sky that don't look quite like planes? The answer is simple. Interdimensional pirates, sailing their advanced ships through the rift beneath RGU and sailing off down the river to plunder whatever they find. Rumour has it they break into RGU after hours to loot whatever is left behind. We had an eyewitness from the library who after studying for 18 hours and running purely on coffee wh claimed they saw a pirate dancing around! Shocking!</h3>

                <h3>Have you not noticed lately that there's a suspicous lack of snow? Did you ever wonder why? It's because the Yeti's are diverting it all to their snow peaked lairs. They're building up an army of snowmen to invade an take over, bringing a never ending winter to the land and ruling over us all! The governments of the world are trying to fight this with a new strategy, "Global Warming".</h3>

                <h3>This is such an obvious truth it doesn't even need to be dicussed. Our planet is flat, with dimensional rifts surounding the edges that transport you to the otherside, giving the illusion that this planet is round, but we all know the truth. Some people say the world is a triangle, but that's just nonsense. No evidence behind that whatsoever!</h3>

It is our belief, that whales have been sneaking out of the ocean and hiding themselves in plain sight! That od looking tree you walked past? It's a whale! That weirdly painted statue? A whale! Your mother in law? A WHALE! THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!</h3>

                <h3>We've saved the most troublesome truth for last, as it is not for the faint of heart. Two months ago, we discovered a creature lurks beneath the bridge of dee, prowling in the darkness below the land. Some say its a remnant of a past age, others an alien stranded and some even believe it to have escaped the Hollow Earth. Even I have no idea of its true nature. All we know is the name of this cryptid. The Gloperjocker. </h3>
