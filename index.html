                <h3> It's time to open your mind </h3>
                <p> Have you ever noticed things that do not seem oridinary? Things that go against the fabric of reality itself, that make you question what is real, and what is a figment of your imagination created by the drugs the government put in your water? Whatever the reason, you are finally awake and your mind is free, and we invite you to join others like you who see the world for what it truly is. Join us as we debate whether Kyle Martin is a lizardman or a robot sent back in time to establish control over us, wehther or not RGU itself is a cover up for a government facility drilling into the multiverse, where Roger really was on June 4th 1989 or whether or not the dress is white and gold or blue and black </p>
